# Flight-Reservation-System

This C++ project is a comprehensive Flight Reservation System that incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. The system allows users to efficiently manage and book flights, demonstrating the power of C++ for real-world applications.

Features:
1)User-Friendly Interface: The system provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction, making flight reservations intuitive for both users and administrators.
2)Object-Oriented Design: Leveraging the principles of OOP, the codebase is organized into classes and objects, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
3)Data Structures and Algorithms: DSA concepts are implemented for efficient data management, ensuring fast and reliable operations, such as searching for flights, booking tickets, and managing passenger information.
4)Flight Management: Admins can easily add, update, or remove flights, while users can search for available flights, view details, and make reservations.
